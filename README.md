🎓 University Management System
A Java-based University Management System designed to streamline the management of students, faculty, and course operations. Built using object-oriented programming principles, this project showcases core backend development skills, modular architecture, and an extendable structure ready for web or database integration.

🚀 Features
Student, Faculty, and Course CRUD operations

Role-based login system (Admin, Faculty, Student)

Enrollment system for managing course registrations

Modular codebase using Java OOP concepts

Basic GUI via Swing (optional)

File-based storage (can be extended to JDBC/SQL)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Java

Frontend: Java Swing (or console)

Backend: Java classes with file-based logic (extendable to REST API)

Version Control: Git

🧠 Learning Highlights
Implemented OOP concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Simulated a full-stack system from scratch with potential for RESTful backend and React frontend.

Understood CRUD logic and role-based access control for real-world applications.

📈 Future Enhancements
Replace file storage with MySQL/PostgreSQL using JDBC or Hibernate

Create REST API with Spring Boot

Build a web-based UI using React

Add authentication via JWT

Deploy using Docker and CI/CD pipelines

🔐 Sample Roles
Role	Access
Admin	Full CRUD access
Faculty	Course & Student view
